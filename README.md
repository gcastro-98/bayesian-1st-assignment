# bayesian-1st-assignment
Bayesian Statistics 1st assignment, by L. Bocchi &amp; G. Castro, for the Data Science MSc (UB, 2022-23). It consists in:

## Exercise 1: Modelling Earthquake Waiting Times

Both using analytical derivations, as well as, Stan code.

## Exercise 2: Bayesian analysis of the Diaconis' experiment model

We consider a more elaborate mixture prior for the spinning coin. The Bayesian analysis is performed:
1. Using the theoretical formulas (prior predictive pmf, posterior pdf, posterior predictive pmf)
2. Using independent random numbers (``rbeta()`` functions, etc.)
3. Using JAGS
4. Using Stan
